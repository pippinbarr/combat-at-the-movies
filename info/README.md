## Description

*Sure, great works of cinema are great! But aren't they missing something?! Yes! They're missing tanks! Move over Orson Welles! Move over Robert DiNiro! These tanks are ready for their close-up!*

_Combat at the Movies_ features a selection of 10 films from *Sight & Sound* magazine’s [Critics’ top 100](https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/critics), each adapted into the visuals, sounds, and interactions of Atari's classic tank-fighting game *Combat*. The featured films are Citizen Kane (1941), Rashomon (1950), Tokyo Story (1953), L’Avventura (1960), Au Hasard Balthazar (1966), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), The Godfather (1972), The Conversation (1974), Taxi Driver (1976), and Beau Travail (1999). In each case, a scene from the movie has been adapted, experimenting with the question of how (and whether) one can convey some of the same ideas and emotions as a film in the highly limited frame of an Atari 2600-era videogame.
