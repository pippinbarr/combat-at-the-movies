# Combat (as in, the base)

- ~~Get basic tanks up and moving~~
- ~~Get a level working with collision etc.~~
- ~~Get basic shooting with collision working~~
- ~~Add teleportation effect on being hit (seem to just teleport a distance in the direction of the bullet's trajectory roughly speaking? Maybe with some random angle added?)~~
- ~~Pause the shooting tank on hitting the enemy (until it stops spinning)~~
- ~~Deal with teleporting into a wall?~~
- ~~__POINTLESS__ Add controls to the other tank so it's actually two player? Or is this pointless because that won't actually happen ever in the game?~~
- ~~__I DID AND I DID__ Do I really need to implement this level of detail of Combat if I'm not making Combat?~~
- ~~Basic sounds (movement, shooting, death)~~
- ~~Basic AI tank~~

- Improve sounds
- Add some score stuff by default
- Expiry of bullet by distance/time?
- Better AI tank?
