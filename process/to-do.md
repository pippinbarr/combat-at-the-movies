# Combat (as in, the base)

- ~~Get basic tanks up and moving~~
- ~~Get a level working with collision etc.~~
- ~~Get basic shooting with collision working~~
- ~~Add teleportation effect on being hit (seem to just teleport a distance in the direction of the bullet's trajectory roughly speaking? Maybe with some random angle added?)~~
- ~~Pause the shooting tank on hitting the enemy (until it stops spinning)~~
- ~~Deal with teleporting into a wall?~~
- ~~__POINTLESS__ Add controls to the other tank so it's actually two player? Or is this pointless because that won't actually happen ever in the game?~~
- ~~__I DID AND I DID__ Do I really need to implement this level of detail of Combat if I'm not making Combat?~~
- ~~Basic sounds (movement, shooting, death)~~
- ~~Basic AI tank~~

- Improve sounds
- Add some score stuff by default
- Expiry of bullet by distance/time?
- Better AI tank?


# Meta

# L'Avventura (Island)

- ~~Create the island and put the tank on it~~

- Ending: YOU DIDN'T FIND ANNA

# The Godfather (Tollbridge)

- ~~Create basic scene~~
- ~~Enemy tanks at the toll area that shoot you~~

- Death ending: YOU WERE MURDERED BY THE X GANG?

# 2001: A Space Odyssey (Monolith)

- ~~Basic scene with a monolith available~~
- ~~__NO__ Add a whole bunch of tanks that randomly move?~~
- ~~Player and other tank in empty screen~~

- Monolith appears after a delay

# Rashomon

- ~~Create basic idea of four cameras looking at the same scene~~
- ~~Point cameras at different locations~~
- ~~Give cameras different ignores~~
- ~~Do we need dividers between the cameras so it's more obvious?~~
- ~~Add an enemy tank (does it need an AI? Yes.)~~
- ~~__NO THIS IS OVERKILL__ Give cameras different background colors? Tints? Other perceptual differences?~~
- ~~__IT'S FUNNIER IF IT'S THE ICONIC COMBAT LEVEL__ Consider what the tiles need to look like to recreate the basic murder scene (or rather at least one of them)~~

# Some Like It Hot (Pink Tanks)

- ~~Pink tanks~~
- ~~Enemy AI? Or not?~~

- Shooting and winning etc. Just standard combat actually
- Instruction: BE A WOMAN
- Endings: ???

# La Jet√©e

- Basic scenario of the pier, the player, an enemy tank shooting another tank with the player looking on, and maybe a reprise except this time you are the tank being shot?
- Or a version where you control both the on-looker tank and the tank being pursued and shot? (Maybe a baby-size tank?)
- Is this one too complicated to live?
- Maybe it's simpler to have a first scene where you're observing a tank shoot another tank, and then a second scene where you're the tank being shot? (They wouldn't be identical scenes of course, which is bad for time travel.)

# Beau Travail

- ~~__THAT SEEMS DISTRACTING__ Particle effects from the tank's gun as a cigarette? or not that important and potentially distracting~~
- ~~Basic scene~~
- ~~Mirror tank behind the mirror (same as for Taxi Driver - and interesting that there's that correspondence between the movies and then the games)~~
- ~~Create second layer that can alternate for a disco feel?~~
- ~~Let the tank reverse for this one instance?~~

- Add a music loop (MIDI? Sample?)
- Maybe speed up/slow down the rate of movement as with his dancing
- DANCE / THE CREDITS ROLL

# The Conversation

- I suppose at least set up a level with two AI tanks to create the audio and see what it sounds like completely without graphics.
- In the movie it's a murder in the hotel room, so you could have audio of movement for a while and eventually a shot and a death sound
- Think about whether there's a way to make a Gene Hackman tank and what that would look like - don't seem to have a reference for what him listening in the hotel room looks like
- Starting approximation might just be the hotel room and the sound from the next room playing?
- A problem: in the film he doesn't hear the murder, he sees it through the frosted/obscure window
- LISTEN THROUGH THE WALL
