# Combat (as in, the base)

- ~~Get basic tanks up and moving~~
- ~~Get a level working with collision etc.~~
- ~~Get basic shooting with collision working~~
- ~~Add teleportation effect on being hit (seem to just teleport a distance in the direction of the bullet's trajectory roughly speaking? Maybe with some random angle added?)~~
- ~~Pause the shooting tank on hitting the enemy (until it stops spinning)~~
- ~~Deal with teleporting into a wall?~~
- ~~__POINTLESS__ Add controls to the other tank so it's actually two player? Or is this pointless because that won't actually happen ever in the game?~~
- ~~__I DID AND I DID__ Do I really need to implement this level of detail of Combat if I'm not making Combat?~~
- ~~Basic sounds (movement, shooting, death)~~

- Improve sounds

# Citizen Kane (Rosebud)

- ~~Get basic version working (tank dies on shooting, castle)~~
- Uh... make it better???

# L'Avventura (Island)

- ~~Create the island and put the tank on it~~
- Probably need a timer somewhere for this fruitless search to end

# The Godfather (Tollbridge)

# 2001: A Space Odyssey (Monolith)

# Au Hasard Balthazar (Donkey)

# Rashomon

- ~~Create basic idea of four cameras looking at the same scene~~
- ~~Point cameras at different locations~~
- ~~Give cameras different ignores~~
- Give cameras different background colors? Tints? Other perceptual differences?
- Add an enemy tank (does it need an AI?)
- Consider what the tiles need to look like to recreate the basic murder scene (or rather at least one of them)
- Do we need dividers between the cameras so it's more obvious?

# Taxi Driver (Mirror)

# Blade Runner (Time to die)

# Godzilla
- Should I replace this as not arthouse enough? Though it's on criterion, so...

# THX1138 (White space)
- Should I replace this as not arthouse enough? Though it's on criterion, so...

# Indiana Jones
- Should I replace this as not arthouse enough?

# Star Wars
- Should I replace this as not arthouse enough?
