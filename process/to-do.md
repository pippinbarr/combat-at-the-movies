# Combat (as in, the base)

- ~~Get basic tanks up and moving~~
- ~~Get a level working with collision etc.~~
- ~~Get basic shooting with collision working~~
- ~~Add teleportation effect on being hit (seem to just teleport a distance in the direction of the bullet's trajectory roughly speaking? Maybe with some random angle added?)~~
- ~~Pause the shooting tank on hitting the enemy (until it stops spinning)~~
- ~~Deal with teleporting into a wall?~~
- ~~__POINTLESS__ Add controls to the other tank so it's actually two player? Or is this pointless because that won't actually happen ever in the game?~~
- ~~__I DID AND I DID__ Do I really need to implement this level of detail of Combat if I'm not making Combat?~~
- ~~Basic sounds (movement, shooting, death)~~
- ~~Basic AI tank~~
- ~~Add some score stuff by default~~
- ~~Better AI tank? Maybe only as in: it tries not to just ram walls indefinitely?~~

- Improve sounds
- Expiry of bullet by distance/time?

# Menu

- ~~Create a basic menu so you can at least load different levels for testing stuff out~~

- Make an actually good menu (what does a good menu look like?)

# Meta

- ~~__NO__ Contemplate two-player idea for all games? Player 2 as sled? Player 2 as missing woman? Player 2 as Balthazar?~~

# Citizen Kane (Rosebud)

- ~~Get basic version working (tank dies on shooting, castle)~~
- ~~Add a timer (you failed to remember?)~~
- ~~1 POINT for Rosebud~~
- ~~Draw the castle from the movie "properly"~~
- ~~Endings: YOU REMEMBERED, YOU DIDN'T REMEMBER~~
- ~~Instruction: REMEMBER~~

- Better audio?
- Wiggling as Kane tank for some more agency?
- Restore the idea that time runs out and you die, rather than hitting shoot to die


# L'Avventura (Island)

- ~~Create the island and put the tank on it~~
- ~~Add a timer for ending~~
- ~~__NO__ Add calling out her name for shooting (could even keep the bullet?)~~
- ~~__NO__ Bullet could be the word ANNA?~~
- ~~__YEAH__ Or perhaps no shooting no calling? The instruction kind of does the work here? (Only do the audio if I'm wanting to reference Heavy Rain?)~~
- ~~Instruction: FIND ANNA~~
- ~~Ending: YOU DIDN'T FIND ANNA~~

# The Godfather (Tollbridge)

- ~~Create basic scene~~
- ~~Enemy tanks at the toll area that shoot you~~
- ~~__YES THIS SEEMS MORE LEGITIMATE TO THE HARDWARE RESTRICTION?__ Reduce to a single tank surprise-killing you since we might like to keep to the Atari sprite limit?~~
- ~~Add a timer for an ending~~
- ~~Instruction: PASS THROUGH THE TOLL STATION~~
- ~~Time ending: YOU DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE TOLL STATION~~
- ~~__BARZINI__ Death ending: YOU WERE MURDERED BY THE X GANG?~~

# 2001: A Space Odyssey (Monolith)

- ~~Basic scene with a monolith available~~
- ~~__NO__ Add a whole bunch of tanks that randomly move?~~

- ~~Monolith appears after a delay~~
- ~~Player touches monolith then it disappears and player can shoot~~
- ~~Player can't get stuck behind the monolith~~
- ~~Player shoots opponent and that's all she wrote~~
- ~~Instruction: EVOLVE~~
- ~~__YOU EVOLVED__ Winning: something...?~~
- ~~__YOU DIDN'T EVOLVE__ Timeout: should that happen? YOU DIDN'T TOUCH THE MONOLITH? YOU DIDN'T WIN AT EVOLUTION???~~
- ~~__INVISIBLE IN THE END, METAPHOR METAPHOR__ Visible dividing line as the river? (Collides for enemy tank?)~~
- ~~Make AI tank stay on its side (see previous)~~

- Sound for non-firing (maybe just a click?)
- Music pre-monolith to announce its arrival?
- Make the monolith a standard sprite, jesus christ.


# Au Hasard Balthazar (Donkey)

- ~~Fix the broken walls~~
- ~~Make Balthazar wander around~~
- ~~Timer~~
- ~~__BALTHAZAR IS JUST A DONKEY__ Instruction: Ummmm~~

- ~~__LIFE GOES ON__ Timer ending: ?~~

- Improve instruction and timer endings?
- Change Balthazar to not go upside down?
- Alter movement code to use pure random movement?

# Rashomon

- ~~Create basic idea of four cameras looking at the same scene~~
- ~~Point cameras at different locations~~
- ~~Give cameras different ignores~~
- ~~Do we need dividers between the cameras so it's more obvious?~~
- ~~Add an enemy tank (does it need an AI? Yes.)~~
- ~~__NO THIS IS OVERKILL__ Give cameras different background colors? Tints? Other perceptual differences?~~
- ~~__IT'S FUNNIER IF IT'S THE ICONIC COMBAT LEVEL__ Consider what the tiles need to look like to recreate the basic murder scene (or rather at least one of them)~~
- ~~Add shooting for AI Tank~~
- ~~Instruction: FIGHT?~~
- ~~Lose ending: ...~~
- ~~Win ending: ...~~

# Taxi Driver (Mirror)

- Implement "you talkin to me" on shoot at mirror tank (invisible bullet?)
- Point per you talkin to me
- Timer for ending?
- Instruction: PREPARE YOURSELF
- Ending: YOU'RE READY (or maybe not if you have 0 points?)

# Some Like It Hot (Pink Tanks)

- ~~Pink tanks~~
- ~~Enemy AI? Or not?~~
- ~~Shooting and winning etc. Just standard combat actually~~
- ~~HIJINKS ENSUE__ Instruction: BE A WOMAN~~
- ~~Some bugs in there with the game not always ending on death (of player?)~~
- ~~__I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS... Endings: ??? This is a challenge~~

# Beau Travail

- ~~__THAT SEEMS DISTRACTING__ Particle effects from the tank's gun as a cigarette? or not that important and potentially distracting~~
- ~~Basic scene~~
- ~~Mirror tank behind the mirror (same as for Taxi Driver - and interesting that there's that correspondence between the movies and then the games)~~
- ~~Create second layer that can alternate for a disco feel?~~
- ~~Let the tank reverse for this one instance?~~

- Add a music loop (MIDI? Sample?)
- Maybe speed up/slow down the rate of movement as with his dancing
- DANCE / THE CREDITS ROLL

# The Conversation

- ~~I suppose at least set up a level with two AI tanks to create the audio and see what it sounds like completely without graphics.~~
- ~~__THIS IS WORKING I THINK WITH A TANK OUTSIDE THE GAME AREA BOUNDS__ Think about whether there's a way to make a Gene Hackman tank and what that would look like - don't seem to have a reference for what him listening in the hotel room looks like~~
- ~~__NO, IT'S TOO SPECIFIC AND DOESN'T GEL, BETTER IF IT'S MORE CONCEPTUALLY ABOUT LISTENING TO A COMBAT MATCH__ Starting approximation might just be the hotel room and the sound from the next room playing?~~
- ~~__SOLVED BY HAVING IT BE A STANDARD COMBAT ARENA__ A problem: in the film he doesn't hear the murder, he sees it through the frosted/obscure window~~
- ~~__YES! AND THIS WORKS WELL WITH THE INVISIBLE TANK VARIANTS__ Tank could be at the top of the screen outside the play area which is occluded???~~

- In the movie it's a murder in the hotel room, so you could have audio of movement for a while and eventually a shot and a death sound
- LISTEN THROUGH THE WALL
- WHO KILLED WHO?

---

# ~~La Jet√©e~~

- Basic scenario of the pier, the player, an enemy tank shooting another tank with the player looking on, and maybe a reprise except this time you are the tank being shot?
- Or a version where you control both the on-looker tank and the tank being pursued and shot? (Maybe a baby-size tank?)
- __YES__ Is this one too complicated to live?
- Maybe it's simpler to have a first scene where you're observing a tank shoot another tank, and then a second scene where you're the tank being shot? (They wouldn't be identical scenes of course, which is bad for time travel.)
