# Why 1 (Friday, 15 May 2020, 15:34PM)

What is the reason for this project? It's about...

## Adaptation

Continuing in the tradition of much of my previous work, I'm still interested in what happens when you try to tell/create one idea/story/experience in a different medium/mechanic. In this case, I'm especially interested in the idea of the "bad fit" that Combat represents as a material for reproducing film (and ideally "great film"). It's in keeping with ideas I've wanted to make in the past in which the central violence of a core mechanic is at odds with what the story needs to say. Adapting films gives the grist for that mill.

## Poignant failure?

In a sense it's in "bad faith" because I don't expect Combat to be able to do a good job with all these moments, but what I think I'm more interested in is putting the tank (violence) in that position of failure as a kind of vulnerability (maybe it's a bit like The Artist Is Present 2 in a way even). The tank is asked to step into a role in a work of art with complexity and subtlety and meaning, and it can't live up to the job. That can definitely be funny, of course, but it also asks questions of the tank in terms of "why aren't you better at this?" "why are you so limited?" "why such a one track mind?" etc.

## Hello violence my old friend

In keeping with the above, I'm definitely interested in making work that interrogates the assumption of violence as a mechanic. Something I like about all the instances in this series of movies (though I need to work on the line-up) is that the violence is ultimately useless or even absent or means something else. In 2001 it's futile, or even explained as primal savagery. In Taxi Driver it's toxic masculinity. In The Godfather you're the target and impotent. In Blade Runner it's all about the dying one. And so on.

## Recognition

In all the games I think it's (probably?) important that you can also just make these scenes recognizable without prompting? Or not? Actually as I write that I'm not sure how realistic that is. It may be the case that they all need a title before they actually work and to help the idea land faster rather than spending time feeling confused.
