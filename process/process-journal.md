# The idea; an initial list (Friday, 8 May 2020, 14:44PM)

## The idea

Initially I thought I'd make a game called _COMBATS_ that would be a direct continuation of _PONGS_ and _BREAKSOUT_, with a very broad brief on what the variations might be. But my brain doesn't seem to work with such an unconstrained palette (and it's not impossible I've ever "done" all the obvious takes on a basic arcade game I wanted to take?). Given that I was recently approached to write something for a special issue of a journal on "adaptation in film and videogames", I suppose my mind jumped to adapting films to a specific game, and since _Combat_ was already on my mind, here we are: adapting various movies into the basic framework of Atari's game _Combat_.

Rather that try to totally exhaust the possibilities (by, say, trying to make 36 of them), I think I'll try to put together a package of 10 (like a "top ten") and then can add new sets as with _Chesses_ if it seems relevant.

I think the general principle here is to be reasonable free with the adaptation, including single player versions (maybe even mostly), rather than require simply mechanical changes to the original game's nature. In essence, then, I'm almost talking more about having the tank from _Combat_ "star" in Atari-esque adaptations of famous films?

If I'm framing this from the outset as a research piece, what would I say is interesting about this activity? It continues my more general interest and work on adaptation of many kinds (_Sibilant Snakelikes_, _The Shining_, _Breakout Indies_, _Ancient Greek Punishment_, etc.). In all those cases a major point of interest is in that central tension between source material and destination material, or tenor and vehicle, or what have you. It's a design challenge, but always ends up being about the available mechanics, as well as the (often comedic) relationships between the imagery of the two different parts? A tank in a wig etc.

Plus it just sounds fun.

## An initial list

Should they all be single player? Kind of weird given that COMBAT is two player, but perhaps that's okay? I'm bolding the ones I think could work for now...

- The Shining (going down a hallway, twins appear and elevators spew blood which kills you unless you shoot the twins first?)
- __Citizen Kane__ (tank says Rosebud when you fire, and then you die... some kind of architecture?)
- __Indiana Jones__ (tank running away from a boulder)
- __Star Wars__ (light sabre duel?)
- __The Godfather__ (toll bridge scene)
- Vertigo?
- __2001__ (monolith? Just shoot at it like an angry monkey? Perhaps alongside other tanks)
- Breatheless (new wave cuts?)
- __Au hasard Balthazar__ (just a donkey in the ring instead of another tank?)
- Stalker (something about the zone?)
- __Taxi Driver__ (looking into a mirror? Could deliver the lines if you shoot into the mirror)
- Some Like it Hot (tanks in wigs? Pretty hard to do with the palette...)
- __Blade Runner__ (AI tank that gives the speech when you kill it? While spinning!)
- Burden of Dreams (pushing a boat together?)
- __Godzilla__ (giant tank? You die.)
- __THX1138__ (tank in bright white environment with nothing else)
- To Sir With Love (classroom of tanks and you have to shoot every student to get them to behave themselves?)
- Night of the Living Dead (flee zombie tanks into a safe house?)

So I mean, that's ten. I'm almost certain it would be possible to do ten more with more thought, this was largely a list derived from some obvious choices and the BFI 100 list.

So I suppose next is to implement the basic concept of a tank.
