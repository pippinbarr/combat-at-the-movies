# Closing statement

In the case of this project, I see the article [Film Adaptation as Experimental Game Design](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/9/4/103) for the journal *arts* in its Special Issue on [The Art of Adaptation in Film and Video Games](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/arts/special_issues/art_adaptation) as the closing statement.

It's Open Access and all that, so have at it if you want to!
